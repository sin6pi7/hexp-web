# hexp-web
Repository for hexp web code i.e. api and user and admin frontends.

## How do I get set up?
1. Install node 6.10.0 (e.g. with n),
2. `npm i` - install dependencies,
3. `chmod +x pre-commit.sh && ./pre-commit.sh` - add pre-commit hook,
4. `npm start` - server is listening on port 3000 (or whatever is specified with PORT env variable).
